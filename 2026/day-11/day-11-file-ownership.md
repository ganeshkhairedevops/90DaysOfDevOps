# Day 11 – File Ownership Challenge (chown & chgrp)

Today I practiced Linux file and directory ownership using chown and chgrp.
This helps in managing access control for applications and shared directories.

## Task 1: Understanding Ownership

```bash
ls -l ~
```

Format:
-rw-r--r-- 1 owner group size date filename

Owner → user who owns the file  
Group → group that shares access
