## 🔍 My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud
DevOps is not just tools or automation.  
It is a culture of **ownership, reliability, automation, and continuous improvement**, where development and operations work together to deliver software **faster, safer, and at scale** using cloud-native technologies.

Cloud engineering enables DevOps by providing **scalable, programmable infrastructure** that can be automated, monitored, and secured.
