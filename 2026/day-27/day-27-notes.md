# Day 27 – GitHub Profile Makeover

## What I Improved
1. Added a professional profile README to clearly explain my DevOps journey
2. Organized repositories by topic (scripts, notes, learning)
3. Cleaned up irrelevant repos and pinned only meaningful projects

## Why This Matters
This makes my GitHub profile recruiter-friendly and easy to understand.
